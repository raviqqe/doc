# `keys` and `values` built-in functions

- The `keys` function returns keys of a map.
- The `values` function returns values of a map.
- An order of keys and values are consistent among different instances of equivalent maps.
  - i.e. `xs == ys` where `xs` and `ys` are maps
- Note that key orders depends on their implementations because maps in Pen are hash maps.

```pen
xs = {string: number "foo": 1, "bar": 2}

keys(xs) == [string "bar", "foo"]
values(xs) == [number 2, 1]
```

# Parallel list comprehension

- Natural extension to list comprehension for `zip`-ish computation
- Not related to parallel computation

```pen
[number x() + y() for x, y in xs, ys]
```

## In Haskell

- With [the `ParallelListComp` language extension in GHC](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/parallel_list_comprehensions.html)

```haskell
[x + y | x <- xs | y <- ys]
```

---

# Use cases

## Zipping

- Example: JSON serialization
- Removal of list comprehension with map iteratees

```pen
String'Join(
  [string
    serializeString(key()) + ":" + serializeValue(value())
    for key, value in keys(map), values(map)
  ],
  ",",
)
```

---

# Use cases

## Enumeration of list elements

- Example: SQL query build with placeholders
- Lists in Pen are lazy.

```pen
" where "
  + String'Join(
    [string
      field() + " = $" + Number'String(index())
      for field, index in whereFields, Number'Sequence(Number'Infinity())
    ],
    " and ",
  )
```

# Future work

- More little language features
  - `sort` built-in function
- Code generator
  - For meta-programming
- Language server

---

# Summary

- Now, Pen has parallel list comprehension for `zip`-ish composition of lists.
