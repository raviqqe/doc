# Stak Scheme

- A bytecode compiler and virtual machine (VM) for Scheme
  - The compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The VM is written in Rust.
- It aims to support the R7RS-small standard.
- Forked from [Ribbit Scheme](https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit)

# Progress

- Library system in `eval` procedure
- `case-lambda` syntax

---

# Library system in `eval` procedure

- Stak Scheme now supports the `define-library` syntax in the `eval` procedure.
- The `eval` procedure creates a new library environment for a given library definition.
- It is implemented by sharing logic of the library sytem in the bytecode compiler.
  - Compiler inception again :)

# Future work

- Synchronous and asynchronous APIs in the same crate
- Unicode support
- Tree shaking
- `define-library` syntax in the command line interpreter
- `include` syntax

---

# Summary

- Building Scheme is fun! ðŸ¥³
