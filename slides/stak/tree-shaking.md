# Stak Scheme

- A bytecode compiler and virtual machine (VM) for Scheme
- The compiler is written in Scheme.
- The VM is written in Rust.
- It aims to support R7RS-small.

---

# Progress

- Tree shaking
- Unicode (UTF-8) support in I/O
- The `include` syntax

# Tree shaking

- Scheme is an **impure** functional programming language.
- Any procedure calls might have side effects in Scheme.
- Even in libraries, we might have top-level procedure calls.
- Variable definitions might also cause side effects.
- No immutable definitions in the R7RS standard.
- Tree shaking is so difficult. ðŸ˜ƒ

```typescript
const foo: number = 42;

const bar = (x: number): number => x * foo;
```

# Future work

- Debug mode
  - Stack trace
- Unicode in the `(scheme char)` library
