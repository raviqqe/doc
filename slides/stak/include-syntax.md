# Stak Scheme

- A bytecode compiler and virtual machine (VM) for Scheme
  - The compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The VM is written in Rust.
- It aims to support the R7RS-small standard.
- Forked from [Ribbit Scheme](https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit)

# Progress

- The (almost) full R7RS-small compatibility
- The website improvements

---

# The (almost) full R7RS-small compatibility

- Stak Scheme is (almost) fully compatible with R7RS-small.
  - Other than the `include` and `include-ci` syntaxes...
  - Stak Scheme does not implement the full numeric tower either.

---

# The `include` syntax

- The `include` syntax embeds S-expressions read from a specified path into source code at the location.
  - The `include-ci` syntax is its case-insensitive variant.
- Its argument must be **a string literal**.
- The `include` syntax is in the `(scheme base)` library.

---

# The current implementation in Stak Scheme

- The `include` syntax is the top-level "meta" syntax.
  - Similar to `define-library` and `import` library syntaxes.
- It is not part of the `(scheme base)` library.
- The syntax is processed by the compiler completely statically.
  - You cannot even call it with any arguments of the other macros whose denotations are string literals.

---

# Other compatibility improvements

- `define-syntax` syntax in `define-syntax` syntax
- The `write`, `write-simple`, and `write-shared` procedures
- Partial implementation of [SRFI 1](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html)

# Future work

- Unicode support in the `(scheme char)` library

# Summary

- Building Scheme is fun! ðŸ¥³
