# Stak Scheme

- A bytecode compiler and virtual machine (VM) for Scheme
  - The compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The VM is written in Rust.
- It aims to support the R7RS-small standard.
- **Aims to be an interpreter with small memory footprint**

---

# Progress

- Dynamically-typed functions in Rust
- Rust integration in Stak Scheme

---

# Examples

---

# Future work

- Auto conversion of primitive types
  - e.g. usize, f64
- Garbage collection of foreign objects

---

# Summary

- Building Rust integration is fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
