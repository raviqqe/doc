# Stak Scheme

- A bytecode compiler and virtual machine (VM) for Scheme
  - The compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The VM is written in Rust.
- It aims to support the R7RS-small standard.
- Forked from [Ribbit Scheme](https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit)

# Rust error handling in Scheme

- Stak Scheme could handle errors from Rust.
  - But it was in a very limited way.
  - Rust primitives **return** error values.
  - If we check returned values and they are error values, we throw the errors.
  - Otherwise, we simply return them.
- In the new implementation of error handling, Rust primitives return `Result<V, E>` where `E` is an arbitrary error type.
  - The virtual machine now capures such errors if error handlers are assigned in the Scheme side.
