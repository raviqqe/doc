# Library system bug fixes

- Macro expansion
- Quotes

# Macro expansion

- Literals in macros need to be matched on expansion.
- Previously, they were not properly matched across library boundaries.

```scheme
(define-syntax cond
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((_ (else result1 result2 ...))
      (begin result1 result2 ...))
```

---

# Quotes

- `'`, ` `` `, `,`, and `,@`
- `(quote ...)` is actual syntax.
- Are symbols inside need to be quoted?

```scheme
'(1 2 3)
`(1 ,x 3)
'(x y z) ; <- ?
```

---

# Future work

- `eval` procedure

---

# Summary

- Fixing a library system is fun!
