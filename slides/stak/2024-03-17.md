# Library system update

## `import`

- `(rename ...)`
  - Renames each imported symbol.
- `(prefix ...)`
  - Puts a prefix to imported symbols.

## `export`

- `(rename ...)`
  - Renames an exported symbol.

---

# Library system bug fixes

- Macro expansion
- Quotes

---

# Macro expansion

- Literals in macros need to be matched on expansion.
- Previously, they were not properly matched across library boundaries.

```scheme
(define-syntax cond
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((_ (else result1 result2 ...))
      (begin result1 result2 ...))
```

---

# Quotes

- `'`, ` `` `, `,`, and `,@`
- `(quote ...)` is actual syntax.
- Quoted symbols can be compared by `eq?` for equality.

```scheme
'(1 2 3)
`(1 ,x 3)
'(x y z) ; <- ?
```

---

# Quotes

- Are quoted symbols need to be different?
  - The answer seems to be no according to the other implementations.

```scheme
(define-library (foo bar)
  ; ...

  (begin
    (define x '(x y z))

    ; This is `(define x (quote (x y z)))`?

    ; ...
    ))
```

---

# Future work

- Compiler performance improvements
- `eval` procedure

---

# Summary

- Fixing a library system is fun!
