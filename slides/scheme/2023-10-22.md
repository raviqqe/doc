# Ribbit Scheme

- A small and portable R4RS implementation
- Bytecode compiler and VM
- Instructions and primitive functions
- Everything is on heap.
  - Only integers and cons's
  - Bytecodes are lists.
  - A stack is a list.
  - A set of symbols is an association list.
- For host languages not equipped with native garbage collections (GC,) it
  provides moving GC.

---

# Stak Scheme

- A fork of Ribbit Scheme
- Its overall framework is the same as Ribbit Scheme.
- Some details deviated from Ribbit Scheme.
- There are many missing features from Ribbit Scheme.
  - e.g. incremental compilation and variadic instruction encoding

# Primitive functions

- In Ribbit Scheme, primitive functions push a result value in a new cons onto a stack.
- In Stak Scheme, it destructively updates a top of a stack.
- In the design of Ribbit Scheme, we have both temporary values and bound variables in the same stack.

```scheme
(foo (+ 1 2)) ; (+ 1 2) -> 3 is a temporary value.

(let ((x 42)) ; x -> 42 is a temporary value.
  (foo x))
```

- Ribbit Scheme doesn't distinguish them and Stak does.
  - This implies that we do not need to push new values onto a stack always to
    treat it as a persistent data structure for continuations.
- No `drop` and `skip` primitive functions.

# `apply` procedure

- In Ribbit Scheme, this is a primitive function.
- In Stak Scheme, this is a part of calling convention.

| Arguments | Parameters | Algorithm                                                      |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed     | Fixed      | Compare an argument count                                      |
| Fixed     | Variadic   | Stuff overflown arguments into a list (1)                      |
| Variadic  | Fixed      | Fill missing parameters with elements in the last argument (2) |
| Variadic  | Variadic   | (1) and (2)                                                    |

# Skip encoding

- In Ribbit Scheme, this is a primitive function.
- In Stak Scheme, this is a part of calling convention.
