- A small and portable R4RS implementation
- Everything is on heap.
  - Bytecodes are lists.
  - A stack is a list.
  - A set of symbols is an association list.
- For host languages not equipped with native garbage collections (GC,) it
  provides moving GC.

- There are many missing features from Ribbit Scheme.
  - e.g. incremental compilation and variadic instruction encoding
