# Ribbit Scheme

- A small and portable R4RS implementation
- Bytecode compiler and VM
- Instructions and primitive functions
- Everything is on heap.
  - Only integers and cons's
  - Bytecodes are lists.
  - A stack is a list.
  - A set of symbols is an association list.
- For host languages not equipped with native garbage collections (GC,) it
  provides moving GC.

---

# Stak Scheme

- A fork of Ribbit Scheme
- Its overall framework is the same as Ribbit Scheme.
- Some details deviated from Ribbit Scheme.
- There are many missing features from Ribbit Scheme.
  - e.g. incremental compilation and variadic instruction encoding

---

# Primitive functions

- In Ribbit Scheme, primitive functions push.
- In Stak Scheme, this is a part of calling convention.

---

# `apply` procedure

- In Ribbit Scheme, this is a primitive function.
- In Stak Scheme, this is a part of calling convention.
