# Hygienic macro

- Stak Scheme
  - There is a typo. (no "c")
  - https://github.com/raviqqe/stak
- Scheme runs on a machine stack.
  - No `std` and no `alloc`
- Compiler written in Scheme + VM written in Rust
- Based on [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit]
  - Stak VM does not pursue portability.
  - The VM is specialized for implementation in system programming languages.

---

# Other new features

- Hygienic `syntax-rules`
- Quasi-quotation
- `read` and `write` procedures
- Symbol table GC
- Ports and EOF objects

---

# Next tasks...

- `apply` procedure
  - [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit] implemented it as a primitive.
- Record type
- `cond-expand`
- Self-hosting

---

# Summary

- Building Scheme is fun (again.)
