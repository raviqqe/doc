# Stak Scheme: The tiny R7RS-small implementation

## Scheme Workshop 2025

Yota Toyama

<!--
In this talk, I introduce a new tiny R7RS Scheme implementation called Stak Scheme.

I'm Yota Toyama.

I'm a developer of Stak Scheme.

# Background

- [Ribbit Scheme, the tiny R4RS implementation][ribbit]
  - R4RS REPL in 7 KB
  - Simple, portable, compact, and fast
- Two separate components
  - Compiler written in Scheme
  - Virtual Machine (**Ribbit VM**, or just **RVM**) written in x86-64 assembly, C, Javascript, Bash, ...

<!--
There is a tiny R4RS Scheme implementation called Ribbit Scheme.

It is very tiny as its R4RS REPL fits in 7 KB.

Its VM aims to be simple, portable, compact, and fast at the same time.

In Ribbit Scheme, one of the primary features is the split architecture of the compiler and the virtual machine.

The compiler compiles source code in Scheme into bytecode.

The virtual machine runs the bytecode as a Scheme program.

Proving its portability, the VM is implemented in various host languages including assembly, C, Javascript, and even Bash.

# Can we implement the entire R7RS-small standard on RVM? ü§î

<!--
RVM is very compact and reasonably fast.

The question is, can we implement the entire R7RS-small, the latest standard of Scheme, on RVM?

-->

---

# Yes, we can! üòè

<!--
And the answer is yes, we did.
-->

# Stak Scheme

- Stak Scheme, the tiny **R7RS-small** implementation
  - The same language design as Ribbit Scheme
- Two use cases
  - Embedded scripting language
  - Standalone interpreter
- Open source on GitHub: [`raviqqe/stak`][stak]

|                     | Stak                       | Ribbit                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "Bytecode" encoding | Structured memory snapshot | Serialization + ad-hoc merging |
| `eval` procedure    | The compiler itself        | A separate library             |

<!--
That's how the project of Stak Scheme started.

Stak Scheme is still tiny but implements the entire R7RS-small standard on RVM.

Its design and goal are similar to Ribbit Scheme.

Stak Scheme is primarily designed as an embedded scripting language.

But it can also run by itself as a standalone interpreter on command line.

In terms of differences from Ribbit Scheme, Stak Scheme uses a different encoding scheme for bytecode,
and the `eval` procedure is implemented differently.

I'm gonna focus on these two topics in today's talk.

# RVM in depth

- Ribbit VM (RVM)
  - A stack machine
- **Everything is a list**.
  - Code
  - Values
    - e.g. lists, characters, strings, ...
  - Call/value stacks
- "Von Neumann architecture"
  - Both code and data in heap

![bg right w:550px](lists.svg)

<!--
Before going into the details of Stak Scheme, let me briefly explain RVM on which Ribbit and Stak Scheme are implemented.

Ribbit Scheme's virtual machine is called Ribbit Virtual Machine, which is a typical stack machine.

On a virtual machine, we need to represent bytecode and Scheme values in some way.

But on RVM, everything is represented as a list including all Scheme values, bytecode, and the VM's state like a call stack.

In other words, RVM adopts "Von Neumann architecture".

On RVM, you can manipulate code and data in exactly the same way.
-->

---

# Code graph

- A representation of a Scheme program on memory
  - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of **pairs**
- Contains both **code** and **data**.
  - e.g. no special interpreter for `eval`

![](./fibonacci.svg)

<!--
On RVM, the representation of a Scheme program is called a code graph.

This example is the one of the fibonacci function.

A code graph is just a DAG of pairs containing both code and data for Scheme code.

Because of that, for example, to implement the eval procedure,
we simply compile an S-expression into a code graph, and execute it as a procedure.

I'm gonna talk more about it later.
-->

---

# Compiling and running a program

- The compiler compiles source code into a **code graph**.
- The VM runs the code graph as a program.
- Code graphs are used at both **compile time** and **runtime**.

![h:160px](compile.svg)

![h:160px](run.svg)

<!--
The code graph is used at two places.

On Ribbit Scheme and Stak Scheme, the compiler compiles source code into a code graph.

The virtual machine, RVM runs the code graph as a program.

We have extra encoding and decoding steps to store and load a code graph as a byte sequence.

In both the compiler and the VM, we use code graphs as a representation of a compiled Scheme program.
-->

---

# Example

```scheme
; Define a `(foo)` library.
(define-library (foo)
  (export foo)

  (begin
    ; Define a `foo` variable.
    (define foo 123)))
```

```scheme
; Import the `foo` variable with a prefix.
(import (prefix (foo) bar-))

; Define another `foo` variable.
(define foo 456)

(+ bar-foo foo)
```

<!--

-->

# Example

![h:450px](./library-system.svg)

---

# Encoding as structured memory snapshot

- A code graph is encoded by a topological sort.
  - Caches shared nodes
  - **A cache table as a list**
- It naturally encodes:
  - `if` instructions' continuations
  - Symbols from different libraries
  - Unique constants (e.g. strings)

![bg right:48% w:620px](merge.svg)

<!--
The encoding of the code graph is conceptually a strucutred memory snapshot.

You can transfer the compiled Scheme program in the compiler into the VM by the encoding and decoding algorithms.

Behind the scenes, it works just like a topological sort with a cache table with shared nodes.

-->

---

# `eval` and the compiler

- The compiler itself is part of the `eval` procedure.
- The compiler from S-expression to code graph is **data**.
- `(incept compiler source)` **embeds the compiler** into source code.
- `((eval compiler) source)` compiles the source code into a code graph.

![](eval.svg)

<!--
In Ribbit Scheme, the `eval` procedure is implemented separately from the compiler.

But in Stak Scheme, the compiler itself is part of the `eval` procedure.

This is because the compiler is relatively large for R7RS as it includes the macro nad library systems.

It is very tedious to maintain two separate implementations of the compiler.
-->

---

# R4RS vs R7RS-small

- R4RS lacks some good programming constructs...
- R7RS-small adds:
  - Hygienic macros
    - i.e. `define-syntax` and `syntax-rules`
  - Library system
  - More built-in procedures and libraries

<!--
So Ribbit Scheme implements R4RS, which is a bit old standard of Scheme.

And Stak Scheme implements the latest R7RS-small standard.

When it comes to the differences between R4RS and R7RS-small,
R7RS-small added some big functionalities like hygienic macros, and the library system.
-->

---

# Macros and libraries in `eval`

- Macros and libraries are expanded at compile time.
- `eval` needs their data at runtime.
- `eval` needs to know their definitions.
  - Transfer macros and libraries from the compiler to the VM.

# Compactness

- TR7, the tiniest R7RS-small implementation before Stak Scheme

|       | Lines of code | Binary size (KB) |
| ----- | ------------: | ---------------: |
| mstak |         9,127 |          108,648 |
| tr7i  |        16,891 |          301,536 |

<!--
First, we compared the compactness of Stak Scheme with TR7.

TR7 is the tiniest R7RS-small implementation before Stak Scheme.
-->

# Benchmarks

- Relative computation time
- Fast startup time for small programs

| Benchmark | mstak | stak | mstak (embed) | stak (embed) | tr7i |  gsi | chibi | gosh |
| --------- | ----: | ---: | ------------: | -----------: | ---: | ---: | ----: | ---: |

| hello     |  1.00 | 1.04 |          0.13 |         0.36 | 0.73 | 0.53 |  9.84 | 3.62 |
| fibonacci |  1.00 | 1.12 |          0.96 |         1.05 | 1.35 | 1.66 |  0.93 | 0.45 |
| sum       |  1.00 | 1.13 |          1.01 |         1.06 | 1.19 | 1.64 |  0.98 | 0.24 |
| tak       |  1.00 | 1.09 |          0.89 |         0.98 | 0.96 | 1.23 |  1.21 | 0.54 |

<!--
In terms of speed, Stak Scheme is comparable with the other Scheme implementation.

It's steadily faster than TR7 and the interpreter of Gambit Scheme.

It's still far behind from the modern interpreters of Gauche.

# Future work

- Type checking
  - RVM is flexible but not as secure as other modern ones.
- Porting to another host language
  - e.g. Go, TypeScript, assembly...

<!--
RVM looks good at every perspective.

RVM is not as secure as other modern ones due to its flexibility.

For example, because of the unified representation of code and data,
user input might maliciously try to modify the code of the Scheme program dynamically.

To prevent that, we need type checking in primitives on RVM.

Porting to another host language is another next goal for Stak Scheme,

to actually prove its portability as well as Ribbit Scheme..

# Encoding shared nodes

- Shared nodes are cached _locally_.
- On the first visit, a node is added to cache.
- On the last visit, the node is removed from cache.
