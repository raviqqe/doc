# Stak Scheme

---

# Background

- Ribbit Scheme is a tiny R4RS implementation.
  - The bytecode compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The virtual machine is written in some host language.
- Can we implement the entire R7RS-small standard on its VM? ðŸ¤”

---

# Stak Scheme

- Stak Scheme is the tiny R7RS-small implementation.
  - The bytecode compiler is written in Scheme.
  - The virtual machine is written in Rust.

---

# Virtual machine

- A stack machine
- **Everything is a pair**.
  - Bytecode
  - Values
    - Including lists, characters, strings, etc.
- VM-level homoiconicity

# Duplicate strings

## Scheme

# Library system

## Scheme

```scheme
(define-library (foo)
  (export foo)

  (begin (define foo 42)))

(define-library (bar)
  (export foo)

  (begin (define foo 42)))

(import (foo) (prefix (bar) bar-))

(+ foo bar-foo)
```
