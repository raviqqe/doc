# Inception: The self-embedding compiler in Stak Scheme

Code duplication is one of the primary sources for bugs and maintenance burden.

[Stak Scheme][stak] is a Scheme interpreter written in Rust I've been developing in the last few years.
While I implemented it orignally as a re-implementation of [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit], I was wondering how to avoid code duplication
