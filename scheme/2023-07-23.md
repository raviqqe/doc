# Schemat

- Scheme code formatter
- Written in Rust unfortunately...
- Uses the same `mfmt` formatter library as Pen.
- Some features are not supported yet.

  - Range comments: `#| This is a comment. |#`
  - Multi-line strings

    ```scheme
    "foo\
      bar"
    ```

# Implementing Scheme in Rust

# Next tasks...

- May implement delimited continuations
  - This requires some cleanup and design.
  - `SubContinuation` type vs functions as sub-continuations
    - `prompt` and `control0` as primitives?
  - Single stack for everything vs multiple stacks (temporary values, frame info, prompts?)

# Summary

- Building a VM is fun.
