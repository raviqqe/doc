# Schemat

- Scheme code formatter
- Written in Rust unfortunately...
- Uses the same `mfmt` formatter library as Pen.

# Schemat

Some features are not supported yet.

- Range comments
  - `#| This is a comment. |#`
- Multi-line strings

  ```scheme
  "foo \
    bar"
  ```

  - Read flags :sob:

# Implementing Scheme in Rust

- VM is mostly done.
  - Written in Rust
  - The core logic is around 700 lines.
    - Mostly re-implementation of [Ribbit](https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit/tree/main)
  - No-std and no-alloc
  - Can be used as a library.
  - Copy GC
- Bytecode compiler
  - Written in Scheme
  - Global variable get/set
- But write codes in Scheme as much as possible.

---

# Next tasks...

- Scheme in Rust
  - More language features in the bytecode compiler
    - Closures
    - Slot variables
- Pen
  - `sort` and `reverse` functions
  - Syntax extension for list pattern matching
  - Compiler improvements

---

# Summary

- Building a VM is fun (again.)
