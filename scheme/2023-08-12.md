# Overview

- Stak Scheme
  - There is a typo. (no "c")
- Scheme runs on a machine stack.
  - no `std` and no `alloc`
- Compiler written in Scheme + VM written in Rust
- Based on [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit]
  - But Stak VM does not pursue portability.
  - The VM is specialized for implementation in system programming languages.

# Next tasks...

  - More language features in the bytecode compiler
    - Closures
    - Slot variables

# Summary

- Building a VM is fun (again.)
