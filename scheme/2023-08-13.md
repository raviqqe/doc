# Overview

- Stak Scheme
  - There is a typo. (no "c")
- Scheme runs on a machine stack.
  - No `std` and no `alloc`
- Compiler written in Scheme + VM written in Rust
- Based on [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit]
  - Stak VM does not pursue portability.
  - The VM is specialized for implementation in system programming languages.

---

# Virtual Machine (VM)

- Stack machine
- Von Neumann architecture (?)
  - All bytecodes, stack, heap objects are on VM heap.
- Writtein in Rust
- No `unsafe` so far

---

# Virtual Machine (VM)

## State

- Program counter
  - Points to bytecodes running currently
- Stack
  - Represented as a list
- Symbols
  - Represented as a list of pairs
- Heap (as an unboxed array)
  - If someone wants to run a VM on actual heap, they can simply box it with, for example, `Box::new()`.

---

# Bytecodes

- Mostly borrowed from [Ribbit Scheme][ribbit]
- Represented as lists
- Core instructions
  - `call`: Procedure calls
  - `set`: Set global/local variables
  - `get`: Get global/local variables
  - `constant`: Push constants
  - `if`: Branch based on condition values
- Primitives: `rib`, `cons`, `skip`, ...

# Compiler

## Main routine

```scheme
(write-target (encode (compile (expand (read-source)))))
```

- `read-source` reads S-expressions from stdin.
- `expand` expands syntax sugar (e.g. `let*`, `letrec`, etc.)
- `compile` compiles S-expressions into bytecodes.
- `encode` encodes bytecodes on memory into bytes.
- `write-target` writes encoded bytecodes into stdout.

# What's implemented so far

## Syntax

- Function/variable definitions
- Closures
- `let` expression and some of its variants
- `if` expression
- `begin` block

# What's implemented so far

## Types

- Signed 63-bit integer
- Boolean
- Pair/null
- Symbol
- Character
- String
- Vector (as list)
- Bytevector (as list)
- Procedure

# Next tasks...

- Efficient representation of argument counts at call sites
- `write` and `display`
- `read`
- `cond-expand`

---

# Summary

- Building Scheme is fun.
