# Daydreaming about an array-based Lisp language...

---

# Types

- Float64
- Symbol
- Function
- Array
- Nil
  - `()` = `0` = `false`

---

# Types

---

# Design decisions

- Operand evaluation order & argument order in a stack
  - Scheme doesn't specify its operand evaluation order in its specification.

---

# Summary

- Now, Pen has parallel list comprehension for `zip`-ish composition of lists.

# Ribbit

- https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit
- AOT compiler + RVM
- Everything is a rib.
  - Rib is a three-word data structure.

## Objects

| #1                 | #2                   | #3                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| instruction number | operand or something | pointer to next instruction |

## Bytecodes

- You can GC

| #1                 | #2                   | #3                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| instruction number | operand or something | pointer to next instruction |
