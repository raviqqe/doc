# Daydreaming about an array-based Lisp language...

- https://github.com/raviqqe/arachne

---

# Progress so far

- Single-word runtime value with NaN boxing
- Reference counting GC
- Interpreter
  - AST-based implementation of primitive operations
  - Bytecode VM
    - Work in progress...

---

# VM instructions

Nil, Float64, Symbol, Local, Get, Set, Length, Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Call, Closure, Equal, Array, Drop, Dump, Jump, Return

---

# Types

- Float64
- Symbol
- Function
- Array
- Nil
  - `()` = `0` = `false`

---

# Design decisions

- Operand evaluation order & argument order in a stack
  - Scheme doesn't specify its operand evaluation order in its specification.
- Tight or loose coupling between bytecode compiler and VM
  - Is it ok to embed runtime values into bytecodes?
  - Do we want to save bytecodes of modules in a file system?

---

# Summary

- Daydreaming a language is fun.

---

# Ribbit

- https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit
- AOT compiler + RVM
- Everything is a rib.
  - Rib is a three-word data structure.

## Objects

| #1  | #2  | #3       |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| car | cdr | type tag |

## Bytecodes

- You can GC bytecodes!

| #1                 | #2      | #3                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------- |
| instruction number | operand | pointer to next instruction |
