# Relaxed atomic operations in reference counting

- Reference counting can use relaxed atomic or non-atomic operations sometimes.
  - For only references never shared by multiple threads
- Part of [the Perceus reference counting algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/perceus-garbage-free-reference-counting-with-reuse/)

## Benchmark

- Conway's game of life
- Size: 20 x 40
- Iterations: 100
- ~30% improvement in time

Before:

```sh
> hyperfine -w 3 ~/app-old
Benchmark 1: /home/raviqqe/app-old
  Time (mean ± σ):      1.713 s ±  0.010 s    [User: 1.659 s, System: 0.009 s]
  Range (min … max):    1.701 s …  1.735 s    10 runs
```

After:

```sh
> hyperfine -w 3 ~/app-new
Benchmark 1: /home/raviqqe/app-new
  Time (mean ± σ):      1.186 s ±  0.021 s    [User: 1.133 s, System: 0.007 s]
  Range (min … max):    1.167 s …  1.229 s    10 runs
```

# Record update benchmark

- The previous result had several performance bugs!
  - Inefficient map literal compilation
  - Non-unique references

## Configuration

- Hash map initialization with many entries
- A number of entries: 100,000
- Key type: 64-bit floating point number

---

## Results

- Pen is 6 ~ 7 times slower than Rust currently...

### Pen

```sh
> hyperfine -w 3 ./app
Benchmark 1: ./app
  Time (mean ± σ):     274.0 ms ±   2.7 ms    [User: 206.7 ms, System: 16.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   269.6 ms … 279.3 ms    10 runs
```

### `im-rs` in Rust

- `HashMap::insert(&mut self, k: K, v: V) -> Option<V>`

```sh
test hashmap_insert_mut_100000 ... bench:  34,869,571 ns/iter (+/- 4,337,627)
```

# Next plans

- Reference counting optimization
  - Unboxing small records [#671](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/671)
  - Other basic optimizations
- Proper C calling convention in FFI [#444](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/444)
  - Compiling to MLIR?

# Record update benchmark

## No uniqueness check

```sh
> for _ in $(seq 5); do time ./app; done
./app  7.98s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 8.302 total
./app  7.70s user 0.24s system 99% cpu 7.991 total
./app  7.71s user 0.29s system 99% cpu 8.052 total
./app  7.76s user 0.31s system 99% cpu 8.117 total
./app  8.10s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 8.423 total
```

## Acquire ordering

```sh
> for _ in $(seq 5); do time ./app; done
./app  7.68s user 0.28s system 99% cpu 8.019 total
./app  7.57s user 0.32s system 99% cpu 7.950 total
./app  7.63s user 0.22s system 99% cpu 7.905 total
./app  7.58s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 7.899 total
./app  7.59s user 0.27s system 99% cpu 7.933 total
```

## Relaxed (buggy) ordering

```sh
> for _ in $(seq 5); do time ./app; done
./app  7.46s user 0.30s system 99% cpu 7.817 total
./app  7.41s user 0.24s system 99% cpu 7.703 total
./app  7.51s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 7.823 total
./app  7.47s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 7.775 total
./app  7.42s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 7.734 total
```

## Relaxed (correct) ordering

```sh
> for _ in $(seq 5); do time ./app; done
./app  7.60s user 0.26s system 99% cpu 7.930 total
./app  7.50s user 0.29s system 99% cpu 7.860 total
./app  7.60s user 0.27s system 99% cpu 7.940 total
./app  7.56s user 0.25s system 99% cpu 7.865 total
./app  7.55s user 0.27s system 99% cpu 7.878 total

# Game of life benchmark

- Relaxed atomic operations for thunks

Before:

```sh
> hyperfine ./app
Benchmark 1: ./app
