# Code formatter

- Pull request: [#874](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/874)
- The previous work
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
  - [Wadler's prettier printer](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf)
    - Written in Haskell
- AST -> Doc -> String
  - Doc: IR for formatted codes
    - It represents all the possible formatted codes in one format.

# Code formatter (continued)

- Rewritten once...
  - v1: AST -> String
  - v2: AST -> Doc -> String
  - 5 times faster!

# Documentation generator

- Pull request: [#878](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/878)
- It's all about formatting codes as well. 
  - But in a flipped way
  - Codes in comments v.s. comments in codes
- Reuses the same formatting logic.

# Next plans

  - Conway's game of life
  - `Json` package
  - `Flag` package
