# Benchmark result

```log
> hyperfine -w 3 ./app ./app-lift ./app-unlift
Benchmark 1: ./app
  Time (mean ± σ):     234.6 ms ±   1.6 ms    [User: 182.2 ms, System: 2.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):   233.0 ms … 239.0 ms    12 runs

Benchmark 2: ./app-lift
  Time (mean ± σ):     768.5 ms ±   4.3 ms    [User: 715.3 ms, System: 3.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):   764.9 ms … 780.1 ms    10 runs

  Warning: Statistical outliers were detected. Consider re-running this benchmark on a quiet PC without any interferences from other programs. It might help to use the '--warmup' or '--prepare' options.
