# Progress report

---

# String concatenation

- Pen now has a string concatenation operator (`+`.)
- Multiple string concatenations are batched into one.

```pen
concatenateStrings = \(ss [string]) string {
  if [s, ...ss] = ss {
    s() + concatenateStrings(ss)
  } else {
    ""
  }
}
```

# Debug function

- `debug` built-in function pretty-prints values of any types.
  - `\(any) none`
- Work is still in progress.
  - Primitive, record, and union types are done.

```pen
foo = \() none {
  xs = [number 1, 2, 3]

  debug(xs)
}
```

Output:

```log
[number 1, 2, 3]
```

# Type information

- Pen compiles AST -> HIR -> MIR -> F-- -> LLVM IR -> assembly.
- Pen previously had no HIR-level type information.
  - But only at the MIR level.
- We need to inject custom type information for reflection from HIR to MIR.
  - e.g. `debug` function

## Internal representation

Variants:

| offset (words) | data                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 0              | pointer to type information |
| 1              | payload                     |
