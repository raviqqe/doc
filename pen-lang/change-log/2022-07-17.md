# Reference counting optimization

- Fibonacci number is 25% faster than the previous version!
  - Now, it's 2 times slower than Rust...
- Static pointer tagging was preventing direct calls of global functions.
  - Pointer tagging and untagging were not removed by foo.
  - Clang does it but at the level of CIL?
  - Its removal also led to simpler static memory block check.

# C calling convention (no progress)

- The Zig's developer says: https://twitter.com/andy_kelley/status/1527743699836280833
- LLVM's C calling convention is not the one used by C.
  - Linux on x86 uses the System V ABI.
  - LLVM handles only part of it.
    - Register spilling
    - Struct decomposition
- MLIR has it as C wrapper emission for the LLVM dialect.
  - Not released yet. Maybe in LLVM 15?

# C calling convention (no progress, continued)

- C backend again for F--?
  - [F--](https://github.com/raviqqe/fmm) is Pen's lower-level IR.
  - Currently, C backend doens't support guaranteed tail call optimization.
  - [Clang's `musttail`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D99517) needs function signature matching.
    - C's standard proposal also follows the same design for portability.

# Next plans

- Proper C calling convention in FFI [#444](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/444)
  - Compiling to MLIR? Wait for LLVM 15?
- Application development?
  - Web application?
  - WebGL??
  - Currently, tail calls in WASM is only supported by Chrome (and Node.js.)
