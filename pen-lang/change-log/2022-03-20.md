# Built-in map type

- Pull requests
  - [#822 Map type](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/822)
    - More than 6000 lines... orz
  - [#847 Comparable map type](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/847)
- Functionalities
  - Hash-Mapped Array Trie
    - Implementation simply migrated from a `Core` package to a `Prelude` package
  - Deterministic iteration
    - Multi-layer HAMT for hash collision resolution
      - It should be secure enough?
  - Map types are comparable as long as they do not contain any types not comparable.

# JSON package

- Pull request: [#851](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/851)
  - Work in progress
- Parsing/formatting
- Parsing is almost done other than the parts we need map types.
  - Handwritten LL parser
  - No lexer for now

# Next plans

- Upgrade to LLVM 14
  - Hopefully, next week?
- Additional map type features
  - List comprehension integration
  - Map comprehension (?)

# Summary
