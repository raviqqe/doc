### Hash map in standard package

- Hash map is now avaiable in a `Core` standard package!
- Implemented as a persistent data structure of Hash array mapped trie (HAMT.)
- It also provides maps specialied for string/number-only keys.

```pen
TestMapGet = \() none | error {
  key = "foo"
  value = "bar"

  m = map'Set(map'New(), key, value)

  Assert'True(map'Get(m, key) == value)
}
```

---

## Next plans

- Multiple system packages in one application
- Join operation for data parallel computation

---

## Summary

- Hash map is added to the standard package.
