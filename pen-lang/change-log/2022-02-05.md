# Hash map in standard package ([#676](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/676))

- Hash map is now avaiable in a `Core` standard package!
- Implemented as a persistent data structure of Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT.)
  - Some optimizations are omitted for simplicity for now.
- It also provides maps specialied for string/number-only keys.

```pen
TestMapGet = \() none | error {
  key = "foo"
  value = "bar"

  m = map'Set(map'New(), key, value)

  Assert'True(map'Get(m, key) == value)
}
```

# Build system improvements ([#633](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/633), [#702](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/702))

- [Turtle build system](https://github.com/raviqqe/turtle-build) is integrated into Pen!
- This change brings:
  - Completely comprehensive build output
  - Dependency cycle detection in build system
  - `O(log(n))` build on source file edit
  - No workaround hack for Ninja's bug

```sh
> pen build
resolving dependency of bar.pen
resolving dependency of foo.pen
dependency cycle detected: bar.pen -> foo.pen -> bar.pen
error: build failed
```

# Even more...

- Reference count validation ([#652](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/652))
- `Bit` module in a `Core` package ([#673](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/673))
- Binary/hexadecimal number literals ([#698](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/698))
- `#![no_std]` in Rust FFI libraries in `Core` and `Prelude` packages
- Several performance improvements

---

# Next plans

- Multiple system packages in one application
  - `std::process::exit` function in Rust leaves async tasks in a `tokio` runtime...
- Join (select) operation for data parallel computation

---

# Summary

- Hash map is added to the standard package.
- Incoming enhancements on practicality:
  - Multiple system packages
  - Join operation
