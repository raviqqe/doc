# Hash map in standard package ([#676](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/676))

- Hash map is now avaiable in a `Core` standard package!
- Implemented as a persistent data structure of Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT.)
  - Some optimizations are omitted for simplicity for now.
- It also provides maps specialied for string/number-only keys.

```pen
TestMapGet = \() none | error {
  key = "foo"
  value = "bar"

  m = map'Set(map'New(), key, value)

  Assert'True(map'Get(m, key) == value)
}
```

# Build system improvement ([#633](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/633), [#702](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/702))

- [Turtle build system]() is integrated into Pen!
- This change provides

---

# Even more...

- Binary/hexadecimal number literals ([#698](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/698))
- Reference count validation ([#652](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/652))

---

# Next plans

- Multiple system packages in one application
  - `std::process::exit` function in Rust leaves async tasks in a `tokio` runtime...
- Join (select) operation for data parallel computation

---

# Summary

- Hash map is added to the standard package.
- Incoming enhancements on practicality:
  - Multiple system packages
  - Join operation
