# Progress report

- Trampoline function calls in Rust FFI ([#795](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/795))
  - No more stack overflow in Rust FFi
- Validate unused error values ([#799](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/799))
  - Just like Rust's unused `Result` value validation
- Fix positions in error messages ([#805](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/805))
  - Is it better to show "source" positions of types too?
- Global thunks ([#773](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/773))
  - Optimization to cache calculation of "global variables"
