# Parallel list comprehension

- Natural extension to list comprehension for `zip`-ish computation
- Not related to parallel computation

## In Haskell

```haskell
[x + y | x <- xs | y <- ys]
```

## In Pen

```pen
[number x() + y() for x, y in xs, ys]
```

# Future work

- More little language features
  - `sort` built-in function
- Code generator
  - For metaprogramming
- Language server

---

# Summary

- Now, Pen has parallel list comprehension for `zip`-ish composition of lists.
