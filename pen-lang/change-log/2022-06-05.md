# Heap reuse in record updates

- Programs reuse memory blocks if record updates are performed on unique references.
- Part of [the Perceus reference counting algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/perceus-garbage-free-reference-counting-with-reuse/)
- Limited to records with more than one field
  - One-field records are planned to be unboxed.
- Similar to `Arc::make_mut()` in Rust

```pen
type foo {
  bar number
  baz number
}

f = \(x foo) foo {
  # Reuse a memory block originally allocated for x if its reference is unique.
  foo{...x, bar: 42}
}
```

## Benchmark

- Map insertion
- Element count: 100,000
- ~20% improvment in time

Before:

```sh
> time ./app
./app  0.84s user 0.05s system 94% cpu 0.945 total

> valgrind ./app
total heap usage: 2,414,147 allocs, 2,414,074 frees, 262,931,512 bytes allocated
```

After:

```sh
> time ./app
./app  1.09s user 0.03s system 95% cpu 1.168 total

> valgrind ./app
total heap usage: 2,446,293 allocs, 2,446,220 frees, 279,647,432 bytes allocated
```

## Further improvements

- Still so many allocations in the benchmark...
- Pen is missing some basic optimization
  - e.g. [lambda lifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting)

---

# Others

- The standard `Sql` package
- FFI improvements
  - Conversion between lists in Pen and async streams in Rust
  - Type casting of `any` type values

---

# Next plans

- Reference counting optimization
  - Relaxed atomic reference counting with sync bit [#468](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/468)
  - Unboxing small records [#671](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/671)
- Proper C calling convention in FFI [#444](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/444)
  - Compiling to MLIR?

# Summary

- Progress
  - Heap reuse in record updates
- Next plans
  - Relaxed atomic reference counting
  - Record unboxing
