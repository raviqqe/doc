# Heap reuse in record updates

- Programs reuses memory blocks if record updates are performed on unique references.
- Part of [the Perceus reference counting algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/perceus-garbage-free-reference-counting-with-reuse/).

---

# Others

- The standard `Sql` package
- FFI improvements
  - Conversion between lists in Pen and async streams in Rust
  - Type casting of `any` type values

---

# Next plans

- Reference counting optimization
  - Relaxed atomic reference counting with sync bit [#468](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/468)
  - Unboxing small records [#671](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/671)
- Proper C calling convention in FFI [#444](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/issues/444)
  - Compiling to MLIR?

# Summary
