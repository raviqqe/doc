# Progress report

# Multiple system packages ([#744](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/744))

- Multiple system packages can be used in one application package now!
- Previously, you neeeded to choose only a system package per application package.
  - e.g. the standard `Os` or `OsSync` packages
  - All other system-dependent codes were built on top of them.
- This enables developers to build _plugin_ system packages.
  - e.g. An `ActixWeb` package works along with the `Os` package.
- Linking applications is still done by one of system packages in an application package.
  - Multiple link scripts are simply forbidden.

# Multiple system packages (examples)

```pen
import Os'File
import Http'Client

fetch = \(ctx context) none | error {
  s = Client'Get(ctx.Http, "https://pen-lang.org")?
  File'Write(ctx.Os, File'StdOut(), s)?

  none
}
```

# Even more...

- Thunk lock handling ([#774](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/774))
- Algorithm examples ([#747](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/747))
- Several bug fixes and performance improvements

---

# Next plans

- Proper tail calls in Rust FFI ([#757](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/757))
  - Without this, some programs in Pen can _leak_ stack memory.
- Built-in map type ([#634](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen/pull/634))
  - Some language design work is still required.

# Summary

- Progress
  - Multiple system packges can be used in one application package now!
- Future plans
  - More work to stabilize Rust FFI...
  - Built-in map type
