# (Full) lambda lifting

- Flatten nested functions into global functions.
- Pen supports lifting closures with free variables.
  - So far, it supported only the cases where no free variable exists.
- MIR normalization to the A-normal(-ish) form is also introduced for this change.
  - In the future, it'll be easier to write passes at the MIR level.

# (Full) lambda lifting

## Algorithm

Before:

```pen
f = \(x number) number {
  g = \(y string) number {
    # ...
  }

  g(y)
}
```

---

# (Full) lambda lifting

## Algorithm

After:

```pen
f = \(x number) number {
  lifted_g(y, x)
}

lifted_g = \(y string, x number) number {
  # ...
}
```

# Benchmark

|                 | Speed up | Heap allocation decrease |
| --------------- | -------: | -----------------------: |
| Hash map insert |       6% |                    37.7% |
| Hash map update |       5% |                    38.9% |

- Probably, heap allocation is not a bottle neck in those cases...
- The bottle neck might be redundant hash calculation?

# Snake game

> Demo

## Missing language features

- Pretty printing for debugging
- String concatenation operator
- General list pattern match
  - Currently, Pen can match only a head and a tail.

---

# Next plans

- More applications?
  - Web services
  - Games
- Language features
