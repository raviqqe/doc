# Progress report

---

# `Reflect` package

- `Reflect` package is added for reflection.
- By using it, programs can access type information of values at runtime.
- Currently, it has two functions.
  - `Debug`
    - Type: `\(any) string`
    - Pretty-prints a value.
  - `Equal`
    - Type: `\(any, any) boolean | none`
    - Compares values for partial equality.

---

# `Test` package

- Assertions functions in the `Test` package can now pretty-print values on failures.

Test code:

```pen
Check = \() none | error {
  Assert'Equal(42, none)
}
```

Output:

```log
foo.test.pen
        FAIL    Check
                Message: values are not equal (found: 42) (expected: none)
summary
        FAIL    0 passed, 1 failed

```

# C calling convention

- The C calling convention is implemented in the Pen compiler.
- It's based on [the System V x86-64 ABI](https://uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf).
  - Many other platforms also have adopted it.
- Many hacks to circumvent a fake C calling convention is removed from the compiler.
  - Variant types are passed on stack instead of heap if necessary.

# Compiler optimization

Miscellaneous optimization in the Pen compiler.

- Functional algorithm to imperative for CPS transformation
- Unique names for local variables in F--
- Type compilation cache

---

# Others

- Everything runs on macOS with M1 chip now.
- Content hash-based rebuilds
  - Implemented in the Turtle build system

---

# Next plan

- More lower-hanging fruits for compiler optimization

---

# Summary

- Progress
  - Debug function
- Next plans
