# Progress report

---

# `Reflect` package

- `Reflect` package is added for reflection.
- By using it, programs can access type information of runtime values.
- Currently, it has two functions.
  - `Debug`
    - Type: `\(any) string`
    - Pretty-prints a value.
  - `Equal`
    - Type: `\(any, any) boolean | none`
    - Compares values for partial equality.

---

# `Test` package

- Assertions functions in the `Test` package can now pretty-print values on failures.

Test code:

```pen
Check = \() none | error {
  Assert'Equal(42, none)
}
```

Output:

```log
[number 1, 2, 3]
foo.test.pen
        FAIL    Check
                Message: values are not equal (found: 42) (expected: none)
summary
        FAIL    0 passed, 1 failed

```

# Type information

- Pen compiles AST -> HIR -> MIR -> F-- -> LLVM IR -> assembly.
- Pen previously had no HIR-level type information.
  - But only at the MIR level.
- We need to inject custom type information for reflection from HIR to MIR.
  - e.g. `debug` function

---

# C calling convention

- The C calling convention is implemented in the Pen compiler.

---

# Compiler optimization

- Miscellaneous optimization in the Pen compiler.
  - Functional algorithm to imperative for CPS transformation

---

# Next plan

- Bug fixes on macOS
- Refactoring...

---

# Summary

- Progress
  - Debug function
- Next plans
