# Announcing the Pen programming language v0.4

I've been working on [a new programming language called Pen][pen] for almost a year. And I'm excited v0.4 release here!

## Introduction

The Pen programming language is a programming language for scalable software development. It aims to make development of large-scale applications easy and low-cost by focusing on **simplicity** and **portability** of software.

## Technical details

So although every function is asynchronous and preemptible, it doesn't require any CPU architecture-specific implementation of context switches. They are simply `ret` instructions.
