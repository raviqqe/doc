# Compiler optimization

---

# Pen's compiler is 4.5 times faster!

- Since the last meetup

---

## What made the compiler faster?

- Codes
- Data
  - Small data makes (apparently)

---

## Imperative algorithms

---

## "Compressing" data

- It's better to "decompress" data later.
  - Function inlining
- All the later passes get slower by the increased data size.
- LLVM handles the "decompression" anyway.

## Others

- foo

# Results

---

# Future work

- Function passes

# Conclusion

- Small data makes (apparently)
